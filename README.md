# SBML-Parser
Developer: Jason Huang

A parser that allows you to run a program using the semantics of SBML.

CSE307 SBML Description:

####SBML Datatypes:
Numbers: Integers and Reals – implement as Python integers
and floats.
```
```
Booleans: True and False – implement as Python Booleans.
```
```
Strings: Sequences of characters enclosed within matching
single or double quotes in a single line. Strings
should be implemented using the equivalent Python
String type.
```
```
List: Finite, ordered sequence of elements separated by
commas and enclosed within matching square
brackets. Elements of the list need not be of the
same type. Implement as Python list.
```
```
Tuple: Finite, ordered sequence of elements separated by
commas and enclosed within matching parentheses.
Elements of the tuple need not be of the same
type.
```
```
#### SBML Literal Representation of Data Types:
```
```
Integer: Positive (no sign) or negative (unary -) whole
numbers in base-10 representation (decimal
representation). An integer literal is one or more
digits, 0-9.
Examples: 57, -18, 235
```
```
Real: A real value is represented by 0 or more digits
(0-9), followed by a decimal point, ".", followed
by 0 or more digits (0-9), except that a decimal
point by itself with no leading or trailing digit
is not a real.
Examples: 3.14159, 0.7, .892, 32787.
```

```
A real can also contain exponents as in scientific
notation. In this case, a real value, as defined
above, is followed by an "e" character and then a
positive or negative integer, as defined above.
Examples: 6.02e-23, 17.0e
```
```
Boolean: True, False (just as in Python)
```
```
String: A string literal begins with a single or double
quote, followed by zero or more non-quote
characters, and ends with a matching quote. The
value of the string literal does not include the
starting and ending quotes.
Examples: "Hello World!", "867-5309"
```
```
List: A list literal is composed by a left square
bracket, followed by a comma-separated sequence of
zero or more expressions, followed by a right
square bracket.
Examples: ["a", "b"], [1, 2], [307, "307", 304+3]

####SBML Operators:

Operator precedence and associativity is given below.
```
01. ( expression ) – A parenthesized expression
02. ( expression1, expression2, ... ) – Tuple constructor

```
A singleton tuple can be constructed by including a comma
after the expression.
E.g., ( expression1, )
There are no empty tuples
```
03. #i(tuple) – returns the argument at index i in the
tuple. Indices start at 1 as in SML.
04. a[b] – Indexing Operation. b can be any expression.
05. a ** b – Exponentiation. base a raised to the power b.
right associative: 2**3**4 == 2**(3**4)
06. a * b – Multiplication. Overloaded for integers and
reals.
07. a / b – Division. Overloaded for integers and reals,
but result is always a real value.


08. a div b – Integer Division. Returns just the quotient.
a and b are integers.
09. a mod b – Modulus. Divides a by b and returns just the
remainder. a and b are integers.
10. a + b – Addition. Overloaded for integers, reals,
strings, and lists.
11. a – b – Subtraction. Overloaded for integers and reals.
12. a in b – Membership. Evaluates to True if it finds the
value of a inside the string or list
represented by b.
13. a::b – Cons. Adds operand a to the front of the list
referred to by operand b.
14. not a – Boolean negation.
15. a andalso b – Boolean Conjunction (AND)
16. a orelse b – Boolean Disjunction (OR)
17. a < b – Less than. Comparison.
18. a <= b – Less than or equal to. Comparison.
19. a == b – Equal to. Comparison.
20. a <> b – Not equal to. Comparison.
21. a >= b – Greater than or equal to. Comparison.
22. a > b – Greater than. Comparison.

```
#### SBML Operator Precedence:

Operators on the same line have the same precedence.
```

01. orelse Boolean Disjunction
02. andalso Boolean Conjunction
03. not Boolean Negation
04. <, <=, ==, <>, >=, > Comparison Operators (for
numbers and strings)
05. h::t Cons operator
06. in Membership test
07. +, - Addition and Subtraction
(Overloaded for numbers,
strings, lists)
08. *, /, div, mod Multiplication, Division,
Integer Division, Modulus
09. ** Exponentiation
10. a[b] Indexing
11. #i(tuple) Tuple Indexing
12. (exp1, exp2,...) Tuple Creation
13. (exp) Parenthetical Expression
```
####SMBL Operator Semantics:

```
Indexing: Operand a must be either a string or a list.
Operand b must be an integer. If a is a string,
then return the b-th character as a string. If a
is a list, then return the b-th element as an
instance of whatever type it is. The index is
0-based. If the index is out of bounds, then this
is a semantic error.
```
```
Addition: Operands must either both be numbers, or both be
strings, or both be lists. If they are integers
or reals, then addition with standard (Python)
semantics is performed. If a and b are both
strings, then string concatenation is performed.
If a and b are both lists, then list
concatenation is performed.
```
```
Subtraction: Operands must both be integers or reals.
Performed using standard subtraction
semantics.
```
```
Multiplication: Operands must both be integers or reals.
Performed using standard multiplication
semantics.
```

```
Division: Operands must both be integers or reals. Operand
b cannot be 0. Performed using standard division
semantics.
```
```
Booleans: Operands for Boolean operations (not, andalso,
orelse) must be Boolean values.
```
```
Comparisons: Operands must either both be numbers or both
be strings. Comparison of numbers (integers
and strings) should follow standard semantics.
Comparison of strings should follow the Python
semantics. Returns True if comparison is true,
and False if comparison is False.
```
####Variables and Assignment:
All variable names begin with an ASCII character, which may be
followed by zero or more ASCII characters, digits, or
underscores.
A regular expression to match this definition of variable names
is: "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*"
Expressions from the previous homework (HW 03) must be extended
in the following two ways:
1. Support for assignment to variables must be added. For
example, "x = 1;". This will include assignment to indexed list
variables. For example, if we have performed the assignment
"array = [1, 2, 3];", and then perform the assignment
"array[2] = 5", then the list stored in "array" should now
contain [1, 2, 5].
2. Support must be added for variables used in expressions. For
example, if x was assigned 1, then "print(x);" will print 1.
Similarly, we should evaluate indexed variables if they occur in
a place where their value is needed. For example, if array was 
assigned the list [1, 2, 5], then "print(array[0] + array[1] +
array[2]);" should print 8.
Evaluating a variable for its value should have the following
behavior. If the variable has had a value assigned to it, then
the value should be returned. Otherwise, a "Semantic Error"
should be reported and your program should stop.
When an indexed list variable is used in an expression, then
both the list and the index are evaluated to their value, and
then the indexed list expression is evaluated. If the variable
is not a list (or a string), or the index is not an integer,
then a Semantic Error should be reported. If the index is
outside the bounds of the list, then a Semantic Error should be
reported. 

####Statement Types:
1. Block: A block statement consists of zero or more statements
enclosed in curly-braces, "{…}". When the block executes, each
of the statements is executed in sequential order.
2. Assignment: an assignment statement consists of an
expression, an equals sign, an expression, and a semicolon,
"exp1 = exp2;". When the assignment statement executes the lefthand side expression is assigned the value evaluated for the
right-hand side expression.
3. Print: a print statement consists of the "print" keyword, a
left parenthesis, an expression, a right parenthesis, and then a
semicolon. When the statement executes, the expression is
evaluated for its value. The output displayed should be the same
as that produced by Python for that value.
For example,
```
>>> print('a')
a
>>> print(['a'])
['a']
>>> print(1 < 2)
True 
```
####Function Definition:
```
A function definition begins with the keyword "fun", followed by
the name of the function, a left parenthesis, variables
representing formal parameters separated by commas, a right
parenthesis, an equal sign, a block, and then an expression.
When the function is called, the block is executed first. Then
the expression is evaluated and the result of the expression
evaluation is returned to the caller.
```
Function Call:
```
A function call is an expression. The function name is followed
by a left parenthesis, and then argument expressions, followed
by a right parenthesis.
The number of arguments passed to the call must match the number
of parameters in the function definition.
```
####Program Behavior:
-Your program will be called with a single command-line
argument. This argument will name an input file. The input
file will contain a list of expressions, one per line.

```
Like So: python3 sbml.py <input_file_name.txt>
```
```
-Your program should process each expression one-by-one, and
produce one of the following three outputs, printed to
STDOUT:
```
1. If the line contains a syntax error, then print:
"SYNTAX ERROR".
2. If the line contains a semantic error, then print:
"SEMANTIC ERROR".
3. Otherwise, evaluate the expression and print the result.
